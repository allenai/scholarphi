For example, in multi-task learning, a single model solves multiple tasks, such as a deep model that has different output nodes for different tasks.  Transfer learning might involve transferring knowledge from the solution of a simpler task to a more complex one, or involve transferring knowledge from a task where there is more data to one where there is less data. Most machine learning systems solve a single task. Transfer learning is a baby step towards artificial intelligence in which a single program can solve multiple tasks.   translational invariance  #image  In an image classification problem, an algorithm's ability to successfully classify images even when the position of objects within the image changes.

U   unawareness (to a sensitive attribute)  #fairness  A situation in which sensitive attributes are present, but not included in the training data. Because sensitive attributes are often correlated with other attributes of one\u2019s data, a model trained with unawareness about a sensitive attribute could still have disparate impact with respect to that attribute, or violate other fairness constraints.   underfitting Producing a model with poor predictive ability because the model hasn't captured the complexity of the training data. Many problems can cause underfitting, including:  Training on the wrong set of features. Training for too few epochs or at too low a learning rate. Training with too high a regularization rate. Providing too few hidden layers in a deep neural network.    unlabeled example An example that contains features but no label. Unlabeled examples are the input to inference. In semi-supervised and unsupervised learning, unlabeled examples are used during training.   unsupervised machine learning  #clustering  Training a model to find patterns in a dataset, typically an unlabeled dataset. The most common use of unsupervised machine learning is to cluster data into groups of similar examples. For example, an unsupervised machine learning algorithm can cluster songs together based on various properties of the music. The resulting clusters can become an input to other machine learning algorithms (for example, to a music recommendation service). Clustering can be helpful in domains where true labels are hard to obtain. For example, in domains such as anti-abuse and fraud, clusters can help humans better understand the data. Another example of unsupervised machine learning is principal component analysis (PCA). For example, applying PCA on a dataset containing the contents of millions of shopping carts might reveal that shopping carts containing lemons frequently also contain antacids. Compare with supervised machine learning.   upweighting Applying a weight to the downsampled class equal to the factor by which you downsampled.   user matrix  #recsystems  In recommendation systems, an embedding generated by matrix factorization that holds latent signals about user preferences. Each row of the user matrix holds information about the relative strength of various latent signals for a single user. For example, consider a movie recommendation system.  In this system, the latent signals in the user matrix might represent each user's interest in particular genres, or might be harder-to-interpret signals that involve complex interactions across multiple factors. The user matrix has a column for each latent feature and a row for each user. That is, the user matrix has the same number of rows as the target matrix that is being factorized. For example, given a movie recommendation system for 1,000,000 users, the user matrix will have 1,000,000 rows.  V   validation A process used, as part of training, to evaluate the quality of a machine learning model using the validation set. Because the validation set is disjoint from the training set, validation helps ensure that the model\u2019s performance generalizes beyond the training set. Contrast with test set.   validation set A subset of the dataset\u2014disjoint from the training set\u2014used in validation. Contrast with training set and test set.  vanishing gradient problem  #seq  The tendency for the gradients of early hidden layers of some deep neural networks to become surprisingly flat (low). Increasingly lower gradients result in increasingly smaller changes to the weights on nodes in a deep neural network, leading to little or no learning. Models suffering from the vanishing gradient problem become difficult or impossible to train. Long Short-Term Memory cells address this issue. Compare to exploding gradient problem.  W  Wasserstein loss One of the loss functions commonly used in generative adversarial networks, based on the earth-mover's distance between the distribution of generated data and real data. Wasserstein Loss is the default loss function in TF-GAN.   weight A coefficient for a feature in a linear model, or an edge in a deep network. The goal of training a linear model is to determine the ideal weight for each feature. If a weight is 0, then its corresponding feature does not contribute to the model.  Weighted Alternating Least Squares (WALS)  #recsystems  An algorithm for minimizing the objective function during matrix factorization in recommendation systems, which allows a downweighting of the missing examples. WALS minimizes the weighted squared error between the original matrix and the reconstruction by alternating between fixing the row factorization and column factorization. Each of these optimizations can be solved by least squares convex optimization. For details, see the Recommendation Systems course   wide model A linear model that typically has many sparse input features. We refer to it as \"wide\" since such a model is a special type of neural network with a large number of inputs that connect directly to the output node. Wide models are often easier to debug and inspect than deep models. Although wide models cannot express nonlinearities through hidden layers, they can use transformations such as feature crossing and bucketization to model nonlinearities in different ways.
