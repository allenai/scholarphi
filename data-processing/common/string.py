    A string that keeps a record of the edits made to it. It preserves a record
    of which spans have been replaced. This allows the mapping of character offsets in a
    changed copy of the string to character offsets in the original string. This class was
    created to help with finding locations in a string of TeX corresponding to entities that
    were found in a transformed version of that TeX.

    By subclassing 'UserString', the typical methods of a string (e.g., 'split', 'lower',
    equality comparisons, etc.) are all exposed to the client, who can use this as if it was
    a typical Python string. When the client want to make changes to this string that
    are tracked by the string, they should use the special methods defined on this class
    (e.g., "edit"). Like Python strings, this one is also immutable (i.e., the special
    methods return copies of the string, not the original string).
