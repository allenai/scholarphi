"""
Most TeX coloring operations follow the same process.

First, detect character positions of entities that need to be colorized. This is done an Extractor
listens to a stream of tokens from a TeX scanner.

Insert macros at the top of each file for custom coloring. These macros should make no assumptions
about what TeX engine will be used to compile the TeX; they should not require that third-party
packages have been loaded, and should check the definition of the TeX engine before attempting to
execute a command that is unique to that engine.

Then, color the detected entities from last to first. Coloring should always start with the
entities with the highest character positions, and going in reverse until the entities with the
lowest. This is because inserting color commands will change positions of all text after the
colorized entity.

Entities will be colorized, each with a different hue. Once the colorizer runs out of new hues, it
returns the currently colorized TeX and list of colorized entities, then resets the TeX and
starts over from where it stopped, cylcing through the same hues again.

If you want a better sense of the colorization process, see the 'colorize_equations' method, which
has more explanatory comments than the other colorization methods.
