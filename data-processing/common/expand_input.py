    """
    Unify the TeX in a file by combining together TeX from the files. The TeX file to be read is
    'tex_name' and it will be looked for in 'tex_dir'.

    Files can be searched for in the tex_dir according to special rules using the 'discover_by'
    parameter. The parameter can tell the method to resolve the TeX filename using the rules that
    are used by the '\\input'' or '\\include'' macros.

    The 'within' parameter makes sure this function doesn't read files it shouldn't. Input files
    are only expanded if their absolute resolved file path is inside the directory specified by
    'within'. If 'within' is not specified, then it will be set to 'tex_dir'.

    Based loosely on the code from the Perl latexpand utility in TeXLive, which is distributed under a
    BSD license: https://ctan.org/pkg/latexpand?lang=en

    Features not supported by this function are:
    * \\includeonly command (which specifies which \\include scripts to process)
    * handling quotation marks around input or included files. In some cases it will work the
      same as LaTeX does, and in some cases it won't. It seems how files are included
      that have quotes differs by LaTeX version https://tex.stackexchange.com/a/515259/198728
    * expanding files that don't use a 'utf-8'-compatible encoding. TeX files can include
      multiple input encodings, even within the same file. However, this function will not expand
      input that fail to open as UTF-8 files.
