# Sometime between versions 3.12.0 and 3.13.3, a change was made that influences how batch
# inserts are made that breaks the function for uploading entities. 3.12.0 lets the code
# create all entities, then bounding box models that refer to those entities, before
# uploading either of them, and it still resolves the references to the entities correctly.
# The references do not resolve correctly in 3.13.3, hence hard-coding Peewee to 3.12.0.
