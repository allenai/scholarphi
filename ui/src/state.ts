/**
 * An object containing all the shared global state. It is designed to be used as follows:
 *
 * 1. For complex properties (i.e., lists and maps), it is expected that when updating these
 *    properties, an entirely new data structure will be created.
 *    This allows components to do strict equality comparisons on these properties to determine
 *    whether or not they have changed. For example, if you add a new citation
 *    to the list of citations, and want the annotations for citations to update, create a new
 *    citations array, and set the 'citations' property to point to this new array.
 *
 * 2. If you want to add new properties, keep the structure of the state as flat as possible.
 *    This keeps us from having to write complex code for setting state and for checking on the
 *    equality of properties when re-rendering.
 *
 * 3. You should pass data from this state through properties, not context. In the past, all
 *    global state was passed through context. Because the much of the state of this application
 *    is global (e.g., IDs of selected elements, queries for the find-bar, the data that was
 *    retrieved from the API), this caused two problems:
 *
 *    * Thousands of components would re-render whenever a single property changed on the state,
 *      leading to a feeling of lagginess when using most parts of the interface.
 *    * We couldn't uses React dev tools to find out what properties triggered a re-render, as
 *      this information is not collected for changes to context.
 *
 *    Although it requires passing much data through properites, for the time being the cost of
 *    more verbose code is worth the trade-off for improving our ability to optimize speed by
 *    having careful control over how global state will trigger re-renders.
